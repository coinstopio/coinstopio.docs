Your recovery sheet should be blank, and the contents of the box should be neatly arranged. Ensure the device has not been preconfigured. INITIALISING THE KEEPKEY Step 1: You will need a KeepKey device, the USB cable included in the packaging, an up-to-date Chrome web browser, your Recovery Card and a pen to write your recovery phrase. Step 1: Download and install the KeepKey Client App from the Chrome web store. Step 2: Use the USB cable to connect KeepKey to your computer. Step 3: Open Chrome and locate the KeepKey Client App. (note: You can get to Chrome Apps by navigating Chrome to \u201cchrome://apps/\u201d) Step 4: Follow the directions on your device to update the firmware and bootloader. Step 5: Select Initialise KeepKey Step 6: Select label for your KeepKey (this can be changed later). A label helps you distinguish your KeepKey in case you own multiple devices. Step 7: Select a PIN between 1-9 digits. (note: We recommend a PIN length of at least 6 digits) You will see a randomised, scrambled keypad on your KeepKey display. Find a number you want to choose, then click on the corresponding location in the KeepKey Client Chrome App. KeepKey scrambled the PIN like this so that the connected computer never learns your PIN. It may seem confusing at first, but once you get comfortable with the PIN entry mechanism, you can use KeepKey on an untrusted computer without worrying that your PIN was discovered. Step 8: Confirm your PIN. (note: Keypad number placement is scrambled again, so you will need to examine KeepKey\u2019s display once more to find the correct location for the PIN choice in the KeepKey Client Chrome App) Step 9: Write down the 12-word recovery sentence displayed on your device. This 12-word recovery sentence serves as the backup for your device, and you can use it to restore your funds if you lose access to your KeepKey. As you write down the sentence, carefully confirm that each word is written down correctly. You are only shown this sentence once, and it is very important that you have it written down correctly and in the correct order. Keep the recovery sentence in a safe and secure place. You will need it to recover your account funds and private keys if your KeepKey is lost or stolen. Anyone who discovers your recovery sentence can access all of your funds.

Once you log into your membership account, you will not be required to log back in until you log out. Learn more here or contact our support team with any questions. How Do I Access My ShapeShift Membership Account with a Passphrase? \u00b6 Drew Dapp 17 days ago Updated Follow KeepKey has an optional security feature called a passphrase. A passphrase can be used to encrypt your private keys. This is an additional word that you can choose to create a \"hidden account\" or \"hidden wallets\". A passphrase can be any word or any set of letters that you might use as a password. Your passphrase should be memorable though. You typically would not write it down anywhere, to eliminate any possibility of it being discovered. If your recovery sentence is compromised, the thief will only see the accounts that are not passphrase protected. By storing a small amount of bitcoin there, you can trick them into thinking they have accessed your funds. The protected wallets are only visible and accessible when the additional word (passphrase) is entered. However, if you lose or forget your passphrase, you have lost access to your assets. Your passphrase is not stored anywhere and no means of recovering it exists other than brute force (trying every possible passphrase). Additionally, the device can't tell when you mistype your passphrase. If you send transactions to an account after a passphrase has been mistyped, it is likely that you will not be able to recover your crypto assets sent to addresses derived from the passphrase. Once you log into your ShapeShift Membership account on your KeepKey device, you will not be required to log back in until you log out. If you have a passphrase enabled you'll need to enter it everytime you'd like to access your KeepKey device and your associated ShapeShift Membership account. Keep in mind, your passphrase will still be required to access the correct accounts upon logging in. Your assets will remain on the same private key - 12-word recovery sentence - they were originally located on with the corresponding passphrase.

This feature is also referred to sometimes called \"Plausible deniability\". To update to Ledger Nano S 1.3, read this guide These settings are useful to have 1 main account and 2 or several hidden accounts from the same wallet, with the same 24-word seed. But take care, these plausible deniability features are delicate to manage, as you are the only one to know a multitude of codes. if you ever lose them, Ledger nor anyone will be able to recover them for you. Do not activate this option if you are not absolutely sure to understand it. WHAT IS PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY? In Nano S, \"Plausible deniability\" is a security feature to face the risk of being threatened and/or forced to give your PIN code. With this option, you will manage 2 PIN codes: First PIN code gives access to your main wallet, like a basic account with low amounts, to check daily payments. Second PIN code, linked to a specific passphrase you need to set up, opens an hidden account, for example to save large amounts, which will be used once in a while. With this option, in case you are forced to recover a wallet from your 24-word backup, only the main wallet will be displayed, and the second account will remain hidden, as long as you don't reveal the attached passphrase. No one can know you have 2 PIN codes attached to your wallet, so you can reveal the first PIN code giving access to your daily wallet, to avoid having your savings stolen from your second wallet. As each PIN is using its own independent counter and PIN comparison is constantly done, it is highly unlikely for an unsuspecting sophisticated attacker to guess that a second PIN is enabled, providing that you give the first PIN to the attacker, and not possible to brute force one PIN knowing another one. PASSPHRASE ATTACHED TO A PIN In your Nano S, go to SETTINGS > Security > Passphrase > Attach to a PIN With this feature, you can create, open and manage a second (and hidden) wallet attached to a specific passphrase, wallet accessible when you connect your Nano S with another PIN code. As long as your session will be open with this PIN code, you will be able to access it. When you disconnect your Nano S or when you quit the standby mode, you will be asked a PIN code, then you can choose to reopen this one or enter the main PIN code. Open the \"Settings\" of the Nano S Select \"Security\" Select \"Passphrase\" Select \"Attach to a PIN\" Enter a second and new PIN code Confirm this new code Enter and confirm a secret passphrase (100 characters max) Enter your first main PIN code to validate To access this hidden wallet, you have to disconnect the device and enter the second PIN. Otherwise, you will be in the \"main\" wallet.You can't set a third PIN code. If you ever set a new PIN code attached to a passphrase, it would erase the first one. To manage more than 1 hidden wallet you need to use the \"temporary passphrase\" option. How to best use the passphrase feature \u00b6 Our recommendation is to use your current PIN for your day to day accounts, holding reasonable assets, and your alternate PIN for your savings account, holding higher value assets. This way, not only will your backup seed be protected by the passphrase, but your \u201cduress\u201d PIN will in fact be a real account with real transactions. This would be much more effective in a plausible deniability scenario. TEMPORARY PASSPHRASE \u00b6 In your Nano S, go to SETTINGS > Security > Passphrase > Set Temporary With this feature, you can create, open or manage an hidden wallet, accessible only in this setting path. As long as your session will be open with this passphrase, you will be able to access it. When you disconnect your Nano S or when you quit the standby mode, this passphrase will be overwritten. You can create and manage as many temporary passphrases as you want, but only one by one - you can't open 2 or more temporary passphrases in the same session.

Next time you will enter your PIN code, you will open your main wallet, not this hiden account. HOW TO RECOVER YOUR HIDDEN WALLET(S) ON A NANO S On your Nano S, just recover your 24 words and set your previous hidden passphrase as a temporary passphrase or as a hidden wallet attached to a PIN code. if you want to attach it to a passphrase: - on your Nano S you must run the 24 words you previously ran when you set your passphrase. If you don't, reset your device and import the correct 24 words - go to Settings > Security > Passphrase > Attach to a PIN - choose a second PIN code and confirm it (you don't have to choose the same one as the previous one you set with the passphrase) - set the exact passphrase you want to recover and confirm it - validate by entering your first PIN code if you want to set it as temporary: - on your Nano S you must run the 24 words you previously ran when you set your passphrase.

Setting up Ledger for the first time\u200a \u2014\u200astart here if you have a new or unused Ledger Nano S. #2. Installing Ledger manager / ARK wallet app on Ledger \u2014if you already have Ledger setup, but have not yet installed the Ledger manager or ARK wallet app on it, follow this process. #3. Using Ledger with ARK Desktop wallet \u200a\u2014\u200ahere we will explain how to use Ledger with ARK desktop wallet. At the end of these articles there are also Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). If that still doesn\u2019t answer your questions, you can join the ARK Slack (#help channel) for community or ARK team help. #1 Setting Up Ledger for the First Time \u00b6 (if you already have it set up or have interacted with it you can skip to #2 or #3) So you\u2019ve got your Ledger Nano S device\u200a\u2014\u200acongratulations! First, connect it to your computer with the mini USB cable. You will be welcomed by Ledger and asked to press both buttons (Ledger only has 2 buttons). press both buttons at the same time to get started Press both buttons again to start configuration, you will be shown this screen: press right button to setup new device (if you previously broke or lost Ledger you\u2019d chose left button to input your recovery passphrase to regain access to your wallets) After you press on \u2018configure as new device\u2019 a new message will show prompting you to \u2018Choose a PIN code\u2019. Press both buttons at the same time to open PIN selection screen At the PIN selection menu you are choosing numbers for your desired PIN. Press the right button to increase the current number and the left button to decrease it. To confirm a number at each stage press both buttons to move to the next number. If you want to delete an already confirmed number scroll through until the little icon for X (delete current number) appears, moving you back one spot. When you enter 4 numbers a checkmark icon will appear letting you know that a 4 number PIN is ok (you can choose up to an 8 numbered PIN)\u2014 press both buttons to confirm. If you want to have more than a 4 number PIN, press the right or left button to choose your 5th PIN number. Make sure to choose a PIN number you will remember as if you forget it or input it wrong 3 times in a row you lose access to Ledger and will need to configure it again from the passphrase, which will be one of the next steps. Once you are OK with your PIN click both buttons at the check icon, which will move you onto the \u2018Confirm your PIN code\u2019 window. Press both buttons and enter your PIN that you chose in the previous step to confirm you really wrote the one you want to have. Useful tip: If at any stage of configuration you feel like you did something wrong or are not sure\u200a\u2014\u200aunplug Ledger and start over. Once you have successfully confirmed your PIN it is time for the most important step\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2018Writing down your recovery phrase\u2019. Press both buttons at the same time to begin. When purchasing a Ledger, you will get a little paper to write down your 24 words passphrase. You can use that or write them on your own piece of a paper (we don\u2019t recommend writing them down on a computer). When you start you will be presented with word #1\u200a\u2014\u200awrite it down exactly as shown and write them in the same order as shown (word order matters so write it down exactly as shown starting with #1 through #24). To move to the next word press the right button, to return to the previous word press the left button. Once you\u2019ve written down all the 24 words, you will confirm by pressing both buttons. Now Ledger will ask you to select random words from your passphrase\u200a\u2014\u200ato move in this list use left and right buttons, to confirm it press both buttons at the same time\u200a\u2014\u200aif you select wrong word, you will need to begin \u2018Confirm your recovery phrase\u2019 section again. If you select the wrong word from the list, this message will show \u2018Recovery words do not match\u2019 and you will need to start over (pressing both buttons at the same time) from step 4. \u2018Confirm your recovery phrase\u2019. Once you have completed the confirmation step\u200a\u2014\u200athis is it, \u2018Your device is now ready\u2019, press both buttons to move into the Ledger main menu. P.S. : Once in the main menu, you are moving through it with left and right buttons, and confirming by pressing both buttons, just like with all other interactions. Play a bit with the Ledger and get the hang of it, if you unplug it and plug it in again you\u2019ll need to enter your PIN code that you chose in step one of this course. This is how you will access your Ledger from now on, there is no need to enter the 24 word passphrase, only enter your PIN. Your 24 word passphrase is safely secured in the Ledger device itself. Make sure you properly save your recovery sheet with 24 words in case the Ledger gets broken or you input your PIN number wrong 3 times and need to reset it! You\u2019ll need to input those 24 words again to open that same Ledger wallet. Now it is time to move to the next phase\u200a\u2014\u200ainstalling ARK Ledger wallet app. #2 Installing Ledger Manager and ARK Ledger App Wallet \u00b6 Now it is time to install Ledger ARK app onto the Ledger device itself. First start with plugging in your Ledger Nano S. Input your PIN code (still remember? Left button numbers down, right button numbers up, both buttons at the same time to confirm). #2.1 Installing Ledger manager Chrome App \u00b6 (if you already have it installed you can skip to 2.2 of this section) If you don\u2019t have Ledger manager installed yet, follow this : head over to https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/manager#get-the-apps and click on Install, which will open the Chrome app store. This is a Google Chrome Browser APP. Once in the Chrome app store, their app will open. Click on the blue \u2018Add to Chrome\u2019 button and a popup will open\u200a\u2014\u200aclick on \u2018Add app\u2019 to install it. #2.2 Installing ARK App Wallet on Your Ledger Device \u00b6 Click on the green \u2018Launch app\u2019 button to open the Ledger manager ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ledger-manager/beimhnaefocolcplfimocfiaiefpkgbf ). If you don\u2019t have Ledger connected you will see this message, asking you to plug in your Ledger device: If you already have it connected, the manager will open. Scroll down to where you see the ARK wallet and click on the install icon: A new screen will pop up on your computer, asking you to allow Ledger manager to perform actions on your Ledger (installing ARK in this case). Press the right button on the ledger device, and wait for it to process. Now you will have the ARK app installed on your Ledger device. You will see a nice little ARK logo in the main menu of your Ledger device! Everytime you will want to use ARK wallet you will need to open it on the Ledger device by pressing both buttons at the same time #3 Using and Interacting With Ledger via ARK Desktop Wallet \u00b6 Make sure you have closed the Ledger manager on your computer, or any other Ledger apps you have running, to be able to interact with ARK you will need to have ARK Desktop Wallet (version 1.3.2 or later from https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop/releases ). Once the ARK desktop wallet is installed, plug in your Ledger, input your PIN and open the ARK app on the Ledger(move to ARK icon with left and right buttons and open by pressing on both buttons at the same time). On the Ledger you will have a screen like this : Now open your ARK desktop wallet that you have on your computer ( to download and install download latest version from https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop/releases ). You will now see a device named \u2018Ledger Nano S\u2019 in your ARK main menu. Click on it to open your Ledger ARK address(es). Now everything is pretty much the same, once you start your Ledger for the first time it will be an empty address. You can send your ARK to your new Ledger address from your previous ARK address(es), a new ARK address, or from an exchange. On the left of the desktop wallet, you will see the Ledger Nano S and its address(es), and under My Accounts you\u2019ll have your previous ARK address(es) that are not part of the Ledger device (the ones you use normally without the ledger). Now we just need to send some test tokens to our Ledger ARK address: All the operations are the same as with normal ARK addresses, except you will now sign transactions with your Ledger (without the need to input your passphrase). 3.1 Sending ARK to another ARK address \u00b6 In order to send your ARK from your Ledger Nano ARK address, click on the send icon at the top right of the desktop wallet. Then input the address you are sending to and enter the amount of ARK you would like to send. After you are done click on \u2018Sign with ledger\u2019 button (notice: since we are using Ledger now, there is no need to input your passphrase as this is now handled inside your Ledger device). After you click on \u2018Sign with Ledger\u2019 check your Ledger device, a text will be shown. Operation: \u2018Transfer\u2019 the Ledger will now show you where you are sending to. To authorize the transaction click on right Ledger button, to reject the transfer click on left Ledger button. If you click on the right button, you will authorize it. Now looking back at the desktop wallet you will notice the summary of the transaction. To execute it just click on the \u2018Send\u2019 button and that is it! 3.2 Voting With Your Ledger Wallet \u00b6 In order to vote from your Ledger Nano ARK address, click on VOTES from the ARK address you wish to vote from inside the desktop wallet. Then click the \u2018ADD DELEGATE\u2019 button. Now you have 2 options, you can either choose from a drop down menu (the 1st line, a list of currently forging delegates) or write the delegate name you wish to vote for (2nd line). Now a delegate will be added to the voting list. But we still have to verify and sign a voting transaction to confirm your vote. Click on the \u2018VOTE\u2019 button. Now we need to sign the transaction with Ledger. A popup will now show in the desktop wallet. Click on the \u2018SIGN WITH LEDGER\u2019 button, and look on your Ledger device where it will say, \u2018Vote\u2019 with an overview of the voting TX. Click on right button to authorize or left button to deny voting TX. Once you confirm on the Ledger device, you will see an overview of the voting transaction in the Desktop wallet\u200a\u2014\u200aclick on the \u2018SEND NOW!\u2019 button to confirm voting TX\u200a\u2014\u200athat is it! 3.3 Changing Vote (Unvoting) With Your Ledger Wallet \u00b6 If you want to change your vote from your Ledger ARK address, the steps are the same as voting with your Ledger. Click on an ARK Ledger address you wish to change your vote for, and click on the VOTES tab, then untick the box next to the delegate you are currently voting for, then click on the \u2018VOTE\u2019 button. Now a popup will show in the desktop wallet. Click on the \u2018SIGN WITH LEDGER\u2019 button, then confirm on your Ledger device using the right button. Now you will see an overview of the un-voting transaction on the Desktop wallet\u200a\u2014\u200aclick on the \u2018SEND NOW!\u2019 button to confirm your vote removal TX. Now if you want to change your vote wait for 10\u201315 seconds, and click on your current Ledger ARK address in the left menu (the one you were un-voting from) to update the view of the voting list\u200a\u2014\u200ait should be empty now. If still not visable, simply restart your wallet. If you want to vote again, just follow the steps for voting under 3.2 of this section! 3.4 Multiple Ark Ledger Addresses \u00b6 As you will notice, once you first start using your Ledger with Ark you will see on the main screen of the desktop wallet, \u20181 Accounts\u2019 listed. After you start using the 1st Ledger Nano ARK address (sending transactions out/voting/sending to another address) and you quit or restart the ARK desktop wallet, the next time you open your wallet with the ledger connected you will now see \u20182 Accounts\u2019. You might be wondering what is that? Do not worry, this is normal. ARK and Ledger support BIP44 proposal, meaning your one Ledger device can have thousands of ARK addresses derived from 1 master passphrase. So you can have and use as many ARK Ledger addresses as you want\u200a\u2014\u200aif you want more, start using the 2nd address (after one transaction out). Once you start your ARK desktop wallet again or click restart in the top right menu, there will now be \u20183 Accounts\u2019, and this continues for as many accounts as you want! To send from any of the Ledger ARK addresses click on \u2018Ledger Nano S\u2019 and on the left you will see a list of current ARK Ledger Nano S addresses. That is all for now! If you have further questions check the FAQ in the section below. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \u00b6 Where can I buy ARK branded Nano Ledger S? You can order it from our shop : https://shop.ark.io/products/ark-brand-ledger-nano-s . My Ledger is not showing in ARK desktop wallet when I connect it, what could be the cause? Make sure that the Ledger manager app (chrome app) is not running (or any other Ledger chrome app / wallet) Make sure that you have the ARK ledger app installed and opened on the Ledger device and in settings you have browser compatibility set to \u2018no\u2019 Check your mini USB cable, is it the official Ledger one or one that supports data transfer (not all mini USB cables are the same)? Hey I\u2019m seeing 2 ARK Ledger addresses in the ARK desktop wallet after I transferred my ARK to my 1st address, what is that about? This is normal. ARK and Ledger support what is called BIP44 ( Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets), which allows the handling of multiple accounts, external and internal chains per account, and millions of addresses per chain. So as you start using the 1st ARK Ledger address, next time you start ARK desktop wallet you\u2019ll see 2 addresses\u200a\u2014\u200a1st one that you are already using and 2nd one that you can start using with same Ledger device, having multiple ARK addresses with a single Ledger device\u200a\u2014\u200ahow cool is that? If you start using the 2nd ARK address, then a 3rd address gets added for you to use\u2026 and so on\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can have as many ARK Ledger addresses as you want and need. This is how you create new ARK addresses on your Ledger. I want to remove some ARK addresses from my ARK Ledger, how can I do that? You cannot remove ARK addresses that have already been used (received or spent ARK), as this is not stored on your Ledger device, but on a blockchain which is immutable (you cannot delete transactions from a blockchain once they have been included and confirmed in a block). I want to reset my Ledger device how can I do it? Input your PIN number 3 times wrong, which will reset your Ledger device and you will be able to set it up again (but be careful, in order to access the same Ledger wallet you will need your recovery passphrase that you were presented with once you setup your Ledger). Oh no my dog ate my Ledger device and i am at the Veterinarian, will my dog be ok? And will I ever see my ARK again? You need to ask your Veterinarian about the first part, but you can recover your ARK. If you have lost/broken your Ledger device, order a new one and set it up again with your (by default) 24 word recovery passphrase that was presented to you when you first set it up to access your Ledger addresses and wallets. On Ledger website it says that ARK supports Ledger Blue device as well and you can actually install ARK on it, but it does not get recognized in ARK desktop wallet? You can actually install ARK Ledger app wallet on your Ledger Blue, but currently cannot use it with ARK desktop wallet as it is not yet supported. ARK team will add option for Ledger Blue owners to be able to use it within ARK in the future as well, but currently you can only interact with ARK wallet via the Nano S device. Do I need to vote for a delegate again from my Ledger ARK address or is the transfer of my ARK from my previous ARK address enough? Yes, you need to vote again. New address, new vote. If you want to vote for a delegate, you will need to vote again from your Ledger device as this is a new ARK address that won\u2019t yet vote for anyone (same as if you\u2019d move from one ARK address to another, you need to vote again from new ARK address as votes are not transferred to a new account). How can I remove ARK addresses from my Ledger Nano S? You cannot remove ARK addresses from your Ledger Nano S once you start using them, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain (which is immutable) and not stored in your Ledger device. Ledger devices only obtain the data from the blockchain. Do I need/want to register 2nd passphrase with Ledger? No, as this would require you to input your 2nd passphrase every time you are using your Ledger. If you lose it, you\u2019d lose access to that ARK Ledger address that you\u2019d register 2nd pass with. Ledger on its own is secured not only by \u201chardware sandbox\u201d, but by (default) 24 words passphrase which is even more secure than the normal 12 word passphrase. Hey I have a suggestion on how to improve user interface / I have found a bug what can I do to help out? If you have found a bug or think something could be improved make sure to open a Github Isssue : https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop/issues and explain in detail what you found out / want improved so our programmers can review and get on it. Oh no! All the Ledgers on the planet Earth have been wiped out by recent alien EMP attacks and dinosaurs ate all Ledger production facilities, what can I do? As long as you have your Ledger seed passphrase (default 24 word passphrase) stored somewhere safe there will always be a way to get access to your Ledger wallets and addresses\u200a\u2014\u200abe it ARK, Bitcoin, Ethereum, \u2026 even without Ledger. (pending you have internet access after the dinosaur and alien attacks) There are Ledger recovery tools online that let you access your Ledger wallets without actually having a Ledger hardware wallet. But use that as a last resort if you cannot get your hands on a new Ledger device (cause you know aliens).

You can order it from our shop : https://shop.ark.io/products/ark-brand-ledger-nano-s . My Ledger is not showing in ARK desktop wallet when I connect it, what could be the cause? Make sure that the Ledger manager app (chrome app) is not running (or any other Ledger chrome app / wallet) Make sure that you have the ARK ledger app installed and opened on the Ledger device and in settings you have browser compatibility set to \u2018no\u2019 Check your mini USB cable, is it the official Ledger one or one that supports data transfer (not all mini USB cables are the same)? Hey I\u2019m seeing 2 ARK Ledger addresses in the ARK desktop wallet after I transferred my ARK to my 1st address, what is that about? This is normal. ARK and Ledger support what is called BIP44 ( Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets), which allows the handling of multiple accounts, external and internal chains per account, and millions of addresses per chain. So as you start using the 1st ARK Ledger address, next time you start ARK desktop wallet you\u2019ll see 2 addresses\u200a\u2014\u200a1st one that you are already using and 2nd one that you can start using with same Ledger device, having multiple ARK addresses with a single Ledger device\u200a\u2014\u200ahow cool is that? If you start using the 2nd ARK address, then a 3rd address gets added for you to use\u2026 and so on\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can have as many ARK Ledger addresses as you want and need. This is how you create new ARK addresses on your Ledger. I want to remove some ARK addresses from my ARK Ledger, how can I do that? You cannot remove ARK addresses that have already been used (received or spent ARK), as this is not stored on your Ledger device, but on a blockchain which is immutable (you cannot delete transactions from a blockchain once they have been included and confirmed in a block). I want to reset my Ledger device how can I do it? Input your PIN number 3 times wrong, which will reset your Ledger device and you will be able to set it up again (but be careful, in order to access the same Ledger wallet you will need your recovery passphrase that you were presented with once you setup your Ledger). Oh no my dog ate my Ledger device and i am at the Veterinarian, will my dog be ok? And will I ever see my ARK again? You need to ask your Veterinarian about the first part, but you can recover your ARK. If you have lost/broken your Ledger device, order a new one and set it up again with your (by default) 24 word recovery passphrase that was presented to you when you first set it up to access your Ledger addresses and wallets. On Ledger website it says that ARK supports Ledger Blue device as well and you can actually install ARK on it, but it does not get recognized in ARK desktop wallet? You can actually install ARK Ledger app wallet on your Ledger Blue, but currently cannot use it with ARK desktop wallet as it is not yet supported. ARK team will add option for Ledger Blue owners to be able to use it within ARK in the future as well, but currently you can only interact with ARK wallet via the Nano S device. Do I need to vote for a delegate again from my Ledger ARK address or is the transfer of my ARK from my previous ARK address enough? Yes, you need to vote again. New address, new vote. If you want to vote for a delegate, you will need to vote again from your Ledger device as this is a new ARK address that won\u2019t yet vote for anyone (same as if you\u2019d move from one ARK address to another, you need to vote again from new ARK address as votes are not transferred to a new account). How can I remove ARK addresses from my Ledger Nano S? You cannot remove ARK addresses from your Ledger Nano S once you start using them, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain (which is immutable) and not stored in your Ledger device. Ledger devices only obtain the data from the blockchain. Do I need/want to register 2nd passphrase with Ledger? No, as this would require you to input your 2nd passphrase every time you are using your Ledger. If you lose it, you\u2019d lose access to that ARK Ledger address that you\u2019d register 2nd pass with. Ledger on its own is secured not only by \u201chardware sandbox\u201d, but by (default) 24 words passphrase which is even more secure than the normal 12 word passphrase. Hey I have a suggestion on how to improve user interface / I have found a bug what can I do to help out? If you have found a bug or think something could be improved make sure to open a Github Isssue : https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop/issues and explain in detail what you found out / want improved so our programmers can review and get on it. Oh no! All the Ledgers on the planet Earth have been wiped out by recent alien EMP attacks and dinosaurs ate all Ledger production facilities, what can I do? As long as you have your Ledger seed passphrase (default 24 word passphrase) stored somewhere safe there will always be a way to get access to your Ledger wallets and addresses\u200a\u2014\u200abe it ARK, Bitcoin, Ethereum, \u2026 even without Ledger. (pending you have internet access after the dinosaur and alien attacks) There are Ledger recovery tools online that let you access your Ledger wallets without actually having a Ledger hardware wallet. But use that as a last resort if you cannot get your hands on a new Ledger device (cause you know aliens).

The private keys are generated from a 24 word mnemonic seed which should be stored securely to allow for recovery of the contents of the hardware wallet in the case of loss or damage. The key does not provide access to one HYC account, it in fact allows users to control multiple HYC addresses with a single secured key. The private key stored on the Ledger Device never interacts with any networked environment, transactions are instead signed securely within the device, and then returned to the application as signed, valid transactions. Here at HYCON we strongly advocate the use of hardware wallets as a secure way for users to interact with the blockchain, and we are endeavoring to make the process as smooth as possible. In order to use a Ledger Device to interact with the HYCON network, the most convenient way is to use our desktop client, however Ledger functionality is also present in the GUI interface provided by a full HYCON node.

If you, for instance, want to name your wallet MoneroWallet , the command would be as follows: monero-wallet-cli.exe --generate-from-device MoneroWallet --restore-height 1580000 --subaddress-lookahead 3:200 (Win 7 + 8) .\\monero-wallet-cli.exe --generate-from-device MoneroWallet --restore-height 1580000 --subaddress-lookahead 3:200 (Win 10) Step 4 - The CLI will, after executing aforementioned command, prompt your for a password. Make sure to set a strong password and confirm it thereafter. Step 5 - The Ledger will ask whether you want to export the private view key or not. First and foremost, your funds cannot be compromised with merely the private view key. Exporting the private view key enables the client (on the computer - Monero v0.12.1.0) to scan blocks looking for transactions that belong to your wallet / address. If this option is not utilized, the device (Ledger) will scan blocks, which will be significantly slower. There is, however, one caveat. That is, if your system gets compromised, the adversary will potentially be able to compromise your private view key as well, which is detrimental to privacy. This is virtually impossible when the private view key is not exported. Step 6 - You may have to hit confirm twice before it proceeds. Step 7 - Your Ledger Monero wallet will now be generated. Note that this may take up to 5-10 minutes. Furthermore, there will be no immediate feedback in the CLI nor on the Ledger. Step 8 - You may, after the CLI has generated your wallet, get an error about the wallet not being connected to the daemon. You can ignore that for now. Step 9 - Type exit into monero-wallet-cli.exe to close the CLI. Step 10 - Note that your wallet files will be stored in the same directory / folder as monero-wallet-gui.exe & monero-wallet-cli.exe . This may be a bit inconvenient. Fortunately, you can simply copy the wallet files to a different preferred directory / folder. Step 11 - Open GUI v0.12.1.0. If you have already created a wallet in the GUI, click Cancel when it prompts you for the password of your current wallet. This should bring you back to the wizard. If you haven't already created a wallet, you should automatically start in the wizard. Step 12 - The first page of the wizard is language selection, which looks like this . Select your desired language to proceed. Step 13 - On the second page of the wizard, which looks like this , select Open a wallet from file . Step 14 - Select the wallet file (which, to reiterate, is stored in the same directory / folder as monero-wallet-gui.exe ) you just created with the CLI. Step15 - Congratulations, you can now use your Ledger Monero wallet with the GUI! If you have any further questions with the GUI, please refer to this guide .

Hardware wallets are considered very secure for the storage of a user\u2019s private keys in the blockchain world. Your digital assets are safe even when using an infected (or untrusted) PC. Before you begin You have initialized your Ledger Nano S The latest firmware is installed Ledger Live is ready to use Google Chrome is installed Install the RISE app on Ledger Nano S Open the Manager in Ledger Live. Connect and unlock your Ledger Nano S. If asked, allow the manager on your device by pressing the right button. Find RISE in the app catalog. Click the Install button of the app. An installation window appears. Your device will display Processing\u2026 The app installation is confirmed. Use Ledger device with Web Wallet Until the new RISE wallet gets released you can use the RISE web wallet with your Ledger device. Simply connect and unlock your Ledger Nano S device; open the RISE app; open the web wallet. If the ledger device gets recognized you\u2019ll be prompted to verify your address as shown in the picture below: After verifying that the address is, indeed, the same in both ledger and the web wallet you could select the right button; this will redirect you to the web wallet dashboard where you will be prompted with all the account information, such as the account balance, recent received and recent sent transactions. RISE\u2019s Ledger Nano S implementation supports all kinds of RISE transaction types. Send RISE through Ledger device When logged in with Ledger, sending RISE is a breeze. After filling in the necessary data a new Modal window will show you the informations regarding the amount, the recipient and even the sender. You will be required to follow the instructions displayed on your Ledger and verify the information matches the information shown in the window. Vote/unvote with Ledger Voting and unvoting with the web wallet using a Ledger Nano S is really easy. Just click on the Forging menu and select the delegates you\u2019d like to vote/unvote. A Modal window will be displayed showing the informations that you would be prompted in the Ledger. Quickly confirm that the data displayed is the on your hardware wallet and sign the transaction by pressing the right button. Register a delegate/username with Ledger device Note: Currently there is no way to securely mine blocks using your Ledger device. Registering a delegate with your Ledger Nano S has the only purpose of reserving yourself a username. To register a delegate you will need to enter the Forging section by clicking the \u201cForging\u201d menu entry in the left pane. A button shown in the upper right hand section of the screen will let you register a delegate by guiding you through the process. Always double checkthe data shown by your Ledger device with the Modal window in the browser. Further Security Notes and Further Developments Although the Ledger Nano S is a very secure way of storing your RISE, always initialize your account by broadcasting a transaction to enhance security of your account effectively reducing the chances of being hit by an \u201cAddress collision\u201d. Some features, even if supported by the Ledger integration, are not supported by the web wallet such as: Multiple account, account discovery, multisignature accounts and second signature registration. They will likely be implemented in the new RISE react wallet that is currently under development.","title":"Rise Web Wallet"},{"location":"Ledger/ThirdPartyWallets/StellarAccountViewerXLM/","text":"Stellar Account Viewer (XLM) \u00b6 Manage your Stellar tokens with your Ledger Nano S device by installing the Stellar application on your device and by using the Stellar account viewer.

In the event that one set is destroyed by flood or fire, you have another backup to enable you to re-create your distributed solution. # Setup","title":"Setting Up Your SafeWords"},{"location":"SafeWords/SafeWordsTroubleshooting/setup/","text":"Setup \u00b6","title":"Setup"},{"location":"SafeWords/SafeWordsTroubleshooting/setup/#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"ShippingDelivery/DomesticAUSShipping/DomesticShippingCosts/","text":"Domestic Shipping Costs \u00b6 Free Shipping is available to all orders shipping to Australian address, with the option for Sign On Delivery available at no extra cost.","title":"Domestic Shipping Costs"},{"location":"ShippingDelivery/DomesticAUSShipping/DomesticShippingCosts/#domestic-shipping-costs","text":"Free Shipping is available to all orders shipping to Australian address, with the option for Sign On Delivery available at no extra cost.","title":"Domestic Shipping Costs"},{"location":"ShippingDelivery/DomesticAUSShipping/EstimatedDeliveryTimes/","text":"Estimated Delivery Times \u00b6 Estimated delivery time is 1 to 3 business days , when the product is not on pre-order.
