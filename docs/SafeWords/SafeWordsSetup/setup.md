# Setting Up Your SafeWords

Your kit should contain the following:

-   3 x SAFEWORDS mnemonic seed storage cards
-   3 x SAFEWORDS card storage envelopes
-   3 x Coinstorage Guru Tamper Evident Seals
-   Instruction card

**FILLING IN THE SEED STORAGE CARDS**

Take the mnemonic seed storage cards and while scrolling through the words on your device, write each one in its listed locations on the cards, making sure to use the correctly numbered boxes on each card.

-   Be careful as the Trezor device will only show you each word twice. Best practice is to fill in all the cards on the first run through and then check them on the second run through.
-   The Ledger Nano S is a bit more forgiving, letting you scroll through the words backwards and forwards as many times as you like.

Once you have finished filling in your card, check it by going back through the words on the device and make sure that all the fields on each card are correct.

Once you have finished filling out the words, you now have the option to do a similar ‘distribution’ with your PIN code.

**DISTRIBUTED PIN STORAGE**

Once you have filled out the cards, be sure to label them with the wallet identifier. This can be used to check you have the correct cards during the restoration process

Next, take each card and place it into one of the long term storage envelopes, and seal each envelope closed using the peel and seal flap.

Next, apply a Tamper Evident Seal to each envelope. Once applied, this seal cannot be removed without being destroyed. Every set of three seals has a unique serial number which ensures that your information cannot be accessed without you being able to find out.

Congratulations!

_The purpose of distributed private key and PIN code storage is incase you ever lose or damage your wallet and need to recover the seed, you need just access two of the three sets of words. In the event that one set is destroyed by flood or fire, you have another backup to enable you to re-create your distributed solution._# Setup
