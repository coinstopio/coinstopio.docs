# Recovering Funds Sent To A Different Cryptocurrency Address

It is possible to send funds from one cryptocurrency address to an address that belongs to a different cryptocurrency by accident. For example, you can mistakenly send your BTC to a BCH address.

For some of these situations (listed at the end of this article) you can use a specialised tool, which allows you to recover your lost funds.

_Important: Always double check the addresses when sending or receiving transactions, as you may lose your funds forever._

  

**This tool can only be used in limited cases.**
