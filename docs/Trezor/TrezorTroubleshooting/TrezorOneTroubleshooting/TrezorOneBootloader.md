# (DRAFT) Accessing Bootloader Mode On Trezor One

**Bootloader** is a preinstalled program on your Trezor device which basically verifies the validity of the firmware software being installed during its first set-up or during updating your device.

It is also needed to enter the [bootloader mode](https://wiki.trezor.io/index.php?title=User_manual%3AUpdating_your_Trezor%2527s_firmware&ModelType=1) during updating your [firmware](https://wiki.trezor.io/Firmware "Firmware").
