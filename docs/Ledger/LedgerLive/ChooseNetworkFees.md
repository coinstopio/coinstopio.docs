# Choose Network Fees

## The Use Of Network Fees

-   The security of a blockchain network generally depends on the amount of work done by miners
-   The miner that proposes the next block of transactions to the network, has to provide proof of the amount of work done to create the block.
-   If the transactions are valid and the proof of work is sufficient, the miner may collect the fees offered in the included transactions, as a reward for the work done

## Choose Your Network Fees

When [sending cryptocurrency], the network fees you offer determine your priority in the queue of pending transactions. Miners will prioritise transactions that offer high fees.

_Choose high fees if you require fast confirmation or lower fees if you can wait a while to save on fees._

For your convenience, Ledger Live dynamically estimates three levels of fees or allows custom fees for advanced users:

-   **High:** the transaction _should_ be included in the next block (~10 min for Bitcoin)
-   **Standard:** the transaction _should_ be included within 3 blocks (~30 min for Bitcoin)
-   **Low:** the transaction _should_ be included within 6 blocks (~60 min for Bitcoin)

## Calculation Of Fees

The fee amount is calculated dynamically and will be dependent on the transaction file size. Therefore, a transaction with a more inputs or outputs will be more expensive than one with fewer inputs and outputs.
