# Choose Network Fees

**THE USE OF NETWORK FEES**

-   The security of a blockchain network generally depends on the amount of work done by miners
-   The miner that proposes the next block of transactions to the network, has to provide proof of the amount of work done to create the block.
-   If the transactions are valid and the proof of work is sufficient, the miner may collect the fees offered in the included transactions, as a reward for the work done

**CHOOSE YOUR NETWORK FEES**

When [sending cryptocurrency](https://coinstop.kayako.com/article/54-sending-funds-from-ledger-live), the network fees you offer determine your priority in the queue of pending transactions. Miners will prioritise transactions that offer high fees.

_Choose high fees if you require fast confirmation or lower fees if you can wait a while to save on fees._

For your convenience, Ledger Live dynamically estimates three levels of fees or allows custom fees for advanced users:

-   **High:** the transaction will roughly be included in the next block (about 10 min for Bitcoin)
-   **Standard:** the transaction will roughly be included within 3 blocks (about 30 min for Bitcoin)
-   **Low:** the transaction will roughly be included within 6 blocks (about 60 min for Bitcoin)

**CALCULATION OF FEES**

The resulting amount of fees is dynamically calculated and depends on the file size of the transaction. Therefore, a transaction with a considerable number of inputs or outputs will be more expensive than one with fewer inputs and outputs.
