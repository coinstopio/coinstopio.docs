# Sending Funds From Ledger Live

_Note: Although it takes longer, it can be a good idea to send a small amount of cryptocurrency as the first transaction, and sending the remainder of funds once the initial transaction has been verified as received by the recipient address._

  

### Before You Begin

-   Get the Ledger device that manages the account you plan on sending money from
-   Ensure you have the appropriate cryptocurrency application installed on the device. For example, if you want to create an Ethereum account, you will need to have the Ethereum application installed - this can be achieved via the Ledger Manager function inside Ledger Live

  

## Enter Transaction Details

1.  Click **send** on the left panel
2.  Type the name of the cryptocurrency or search within the drop-down menu to  **select the account to debit**
3.  Enter the **recipient address**. Make sure to [double-check addresses](https://coinstop.kayako.com/article/182-verify-transaction-details) that you copy and paste
4.  Enter the **Amount** of the crypto asset to send, or its  countervalue  
      
    _A countervalue is simply the value of the cryptocurrency you wish to send, against another asset. E.g. Where 1BTC is equal to AU$10,000, AU$10,000 would be the countervalue to the 1BTC._
5.  Choose the **network fees** from the drop-down list. A higher fee leads to a faster processing of the transaction. [Learn more...](https://coinstop.kayako.com/article/183-choose-network-fees)
