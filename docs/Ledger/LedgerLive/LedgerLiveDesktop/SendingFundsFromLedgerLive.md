# Sending Funds From Ledger Live

>Although it takes longer, it can be a good idea to send a small amount of cryptocurrency as the first transaction, and sending the remainder of funds once the initial transaction has been verified as received by the recipient address.

## Before You Begin

You will need:
-   A Ledger device holding the funds you will send.
-   The appropriate cryptocurrency application installed on the device. For example, if you want to create an Ethereum transaction, you will need to have the Ethereum application installed - this can be achieved via the Ledger Manager function inside Ledger Live.

  

## Enter Transaction Details

1.  Click **Send** on the left panel.
2.  Type the name of the cryptocurrency or search within the drop-down menu to  **Select the Account to Debit**.
3.  Enter the **Recipient Address**. Make sure to **[double-check addresses]** that you copy and paste.
4.  Enter the **Amount** of the crypto asset to send, or its  countervalue  .
      
>A countervalue is simply the value of the cryptocurrency you wish to send, against another asset. E.g. Where 1BTC is equal to AU$10,000, AU$10,000 would be the countervalue to the 1BTC.
    
5.  Choose the **Network Fees** from the drop-down list. A higher fee leads to a faster processing of the transaction. View the guide to [select network fees].
6.  Click **Continue**

  

## Verify & Sign

1.  Connect and unlock your Ledger device.
2.  Open the appropriate cryptocurrency application as instructed.
3.  Click **continue**.
4.  Carefully verify all transaction details on your device.

>Check that both the transaction value and the address on your computer matches the address on the device

5.  Press the right-hand button to confirm and sign the transaction if everything is correct. The transaction is then signed and sent to the network for confirmation.
6.  Click **View Operation Details** to [track the transaction]
