## Lets Get Started

When the Ledger Live application opens, you will be given the opportunity to initialise a new device, or recover an existing wallet. To set up a second device, you can restart the on-boarding process from the _Help_ tab in the settings.

### Before You Begin

-   Get your [Ledger Nano S](https://coinstop.io/products/ledger-nano-s)
-   Make sure Ledger Live is installed

### Instructions

Follow these steps to initialise or restore your Ledger device.

_Go to [Step 3](#step-3-security-checklist). Security checklist if you use a device that's already initialised._

### Step 1: Start Ledger Live

1.  Start the Ledger Live application
2.  Click **Get started**
3.  This is where you choose between initialising a new device, or restoring an existing account
    -   Select **i****nitialise a new Ledger device** if you're setting up a brand new device

4.  Select your device, then click **continue**

### Step 2: Choose Your Pin

First you'll choose a 4 to 8-digit PIN code that unlocks your device - remember, the more digits, the more secure. Then you'll be asked to save or restore your 24-word recovery phrase.

_Your recovery phrase backs up the private keys generated on your device that manage your crypto assets. It can be used to recover your device in case you lose the PIN code or the device._

1.  Set up your device by following the steps provided in Ledger Live
    -   **To initialise a device**
    -   **To restore your device**
2.  Once done, click **continue** 

### Step 3: Security Checklist

Complete the security checklist to verify your device is running at an optimal level of security.

1.  Answer the questions on-screen by clicking on **yes** or **no**
2.  Click **check now**, to verify your device is a genuine Ledger device.
    -   Only a genuine Ledger device can provide the cryptographic proof required to connect with Ledgerâ€™s secure server  
          
        _Note: This process may take a few moments._
3.  Once done, click **continue**

### Step 4: Choose Your Password

Choose a password that unlocks the application to enhance your privacy. This functionality is particularly useful if you use a shared computer.

1.  Click **skip this step** if you do not want to set a password.
2.  Choose your password in the **password** field
3.  Enter your password again in the **confirm password** field
4.  Click **continue**

_Note: Make sure to remember your password. Losing it requires resetting Ledger Live and re-adding accounts. This will not affect your crypto assets._

### Step 5: Bug reports & analytics

Besides mandatory technical data, you can choose which anonymous data to share with Ledger to help improve the quality of our products and services. By opting in, Ledger will automatically collect this data. You can decide to opt out at any time from the **settings** page.

1.  Select which optional data to share:
    -   **Report bugs**: Send automatic bug reports when the application crashes to help improve its stability
    -   **Share analytics**: Enable analytics of usage data to help Ledger improve the user experience
2.  Click **continue**.
