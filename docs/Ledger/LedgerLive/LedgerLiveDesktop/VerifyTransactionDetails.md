# Verify Transaction Details

## DON'T TRUST, VERIFY.

>Assume that your computer is compromised and that an address on your screen cannot be trusted. Taking appropriate security precautions during a transaction could be the difference between keeping and losing funds. We've listed a few suggestions below:

-   Always send a small amount first. Then verify that the transaction was properly received by the recipient address before proceeding to send larger amounts.
-   Use secondary communication means when obtaining a recipient address or QR code.
-   Check recipient addresses after you copy and paste. Malware on your computer can replace addresses in your clipboard.
-   Verify that the receive address, amount and fees are correct and that they are the same on both your computer and the deviceâ€™s screen when sending a transaction.
-   Wait for a significant amount of confirmations before accepting a payment.  
      
>For Bitcoin, three (3) to six (6) confirmations are recommended. Please keep in mind this does not mean the transaction has reached finality,  it is simply a range in which it is generally agreed upon that a Bitcoin transaction has become immutable.
