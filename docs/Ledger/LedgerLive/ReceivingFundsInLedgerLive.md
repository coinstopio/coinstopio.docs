**DON'T HAVE YOUR DEVICE?**

**PRIVACY OF BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESSES**

You've generated an address for the selected account, that you can share with the sender.

-   Blockchains based on Bitcoin are public networks. For optimal privacy, the addresses of those cryptocurrencies should generally not be re-used after a transaction.
-   Ledger Live generates new addresses for cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin.
-   For cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin, the previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy.
