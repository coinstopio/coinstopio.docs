# Getting Started With Ledger Live Mobile

The first time you use Ledger Live mobile, it will help you set up your Ledger device and configure a few important settings so you can quickly take your first steps with the application.

To set up another device, restart the onboarding process from the Help section in the settings.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure you've downloaded Ledger Live mobile for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1361671700) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledger.live).
-   Add your Ledger Nano S or Ledger Blue accounts in Ledger Live desktop. [Learn more...](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006410253-Add-your-accounts)

## Instructions

If you're a Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue user, you can easily import your accounts and settings from the Ledger Live desktop app. The app will then run in **consultation mode**, meaning that you can keep track of your accounts as well as see their balances and operation history.

Import desktop accounts

1.  Start the Ledger Live app on your phone.
2.  Tap **Get started**.
3.  Choose the Ledger device you're using.
4.  Tap **Import desktop accounts**.
5.  Start the Ledger Live desktop app, go to **Settings > Export accounts** and click **Export**.
6.  Tap **Scan QR code** on your phone and use it to scan the LiveQR code until the progress loader hits 100%.
7.  Select the accounts to import, choose to include general settings and tap **Continue**.

### Set up password lock (optional)

Choose an optional password that unlocks the application to enhance your privacy. Depending on your phone's functionality, you can enable biometrics to unlock the app without entering your password.

1.  Tap **Set password** or **Skip** if you do not want to set a password.
2.  Choose your password and tap **Confirm**.
3.  Enter your password once more. A confirmation will confirm that your password is set.
4.  Tap the checkmark to enable unlocking Ledger Live using your face or fingerprint.
5.  Tap **Continue**.

>Make sure to remember your password. Losing it requires resetting Ledger Live and re-adding accounts. This does not affect your crypto assets.
