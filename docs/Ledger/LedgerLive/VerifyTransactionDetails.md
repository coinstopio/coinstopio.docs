# Verify Transaction Details

## DON'T TRUST, VERIFY.

**_Assume that your computer is compromised and that an address on your screen cannot be trusted. Taking appropriate security precautions during a transaction could be the difference between keeping and losing funds. We've listed a few suggestions below:_**

-   Always send a small amount first. Then verify that the transaction was properly received by the recipient address before proceeding to send larger amounts.
-   Use secondary communication means when obtaining a recipient address or QR code.  
      
_Example:  when an exchange has a receive address on its website, verify the address through SMS, email or a messaging app when possible._
-   Check recipient addresses after you copy and paste. Malware on your computer can replace addresses in your clipboard.
-   Verify that the receive address, amount and fees are correct and that they are the same on both your computer and the deviceâ€™s screen when sending a transaction.
-   Wait for a significant amount of confirmations before accepting a payment.  
      
    _For Bitcoin, six confirmations are recommended_
