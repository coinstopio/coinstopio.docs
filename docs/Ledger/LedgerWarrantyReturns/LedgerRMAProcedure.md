# Ledger RMA (Return Merchandise Authorisation) Prodecure

>This is the procedure provided to us by Ledger which authorised resellers must follow to receive replacement devices.

### Step 1: **Resolution On Support**
    
The customer must reach out to the Ledger Support team if Coinstop are unable to provide a solution. Click [HERE](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us) to go to the Ledger Support page.
    
### Step 2: **Return Merchandise Authorisation**
    
If the issue can’t be fixed remotely by the Ledger Support team, the customer will be given an RMA number by Ledger to return the device to Coinstop.
    
These two (2) steps are mandatory, Ledger will not accept returned devices if the customer has not received an individual Return Merchandise Authorisation (RMA) number.
    
### Step 3: **Customers → Coinstop**
    
The customer sends the complete box with the RMA number written on their invoice and return address, back to Coinstop - return address will be provided via email.  
      
> We have no authority to accept returned devices that were purchased from other resellers.
    
### Step 4: **Verification**
    
Coinstop will contact Ledger to tell them the item has been received with all accessories, including the RMA number.  
      
Ledger will confirm it is an authorised RMA.
    
### Step 5: **Coinstop → Ledger**
    
Coinstop will return the device to Ledger.  

>Please ensure you have wiped all funds from the accounts. If this is not possible due to the issue had by the device, you can restore your wallet to another BIP39 compatible wallet and move the funds to another wallet.
    
### Step 6: **Exchange**
    
If everything is correct, Coinstop issues a replacement unit to the customer.
