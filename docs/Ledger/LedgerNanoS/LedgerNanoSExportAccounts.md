# Export your accounts

  

Accounts generated by a Ledger Nano S device can be recovered on any (third-party) hardware or software wallet that supports the same standards as Ledger (BIP39/BIP44).

## Before you begin

-   Note that your 24-word recovery phrase provides full access to your accounts. Entering your recovery phrase on a computer or smartphone may be insecure. Avoid doing so if possible.
-   Carefully select a (third-party) hardware or software wallet. Protecting your accounts remains your own responsibility.
-   Contact [Ledger Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/%C2%A0https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) when in doubt.

## Use your recovery phrase

1.  Carefully select a **BIP39/BIP44 compatible hardware or software wallet that you trust**.
2.  Get your 24-word recovery phrase.
3.  Follow the manual of the selected device or service to import your recovery phrase.

## Generate private keys (advanced)

2.  Double-click the downloaded file to open it in a browser.
3.  Type your 24-word recovery phrase in the field _**BIP39 Mnemonic**_. Use lowercase only.
4.  Type your passphrase if you set one in your Ledger hardware wallet.
5.  Select a cryptocurrency.
6.  Leave the field **Internal/External** at **0**.

### Import your private keys

2.  Import your private keys in a third-party wallet that supports this, such as [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.com/) or [Armory](https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/).
3.  Set the field **Internal/External** to **1** to generate the private keys of your [change addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change).
