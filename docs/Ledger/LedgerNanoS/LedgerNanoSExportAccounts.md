# Export your accounts

Accounts generated by a Ledger Nano S device can be recovered on any (third-party) hardware or software wallet that supports the same standards as Ledger (BIP39/BIP44).

## Before you begin

-   Your 24-word recovery phrase provides full access to your accounts. Entering your recovery phrase on a computer or smartphone may be insecure. Avoid doing so if possible.
-   It is preferable to restore to a cold storage hardware wallet. If you can't, carefully select a third party software wallet.

>Protecting your accounts remains your own responsibility.

-   Contact [Ledger Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/%C2%A0https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) when in doubt.

## Use your recovery phrase

1.  Carefully select a BIP39/BIP44 compatible hardware or software wallet that you trust.
2.  Get your 24-word recovery phrase.
3.  Follow the manual of the selected device or service to import your recovery phrase.

>Entering your recovery phrase into a computer or smartphone is a security risk and should be avoided where possible.
