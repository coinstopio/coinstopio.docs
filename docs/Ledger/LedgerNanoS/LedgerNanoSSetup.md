**Step 5:** Select a PIN code between four (4) and eight (8) digits in length. Press both buttons to confirm the action when **choose a PIN** is displayed on screen. Use the right side button to cycle through digits, and both buttons to confirm. Repeat this process until complete, selecting the tick icon to confirm your entry.

_Never use a device with a pre-supplied PIN code or recovery phrase._

_**Step 6:**_ Saving your Recovery Phrase. Take the blank recovery sheet from the Ledger Nano S packaging. As each word is displayed on the Ledger Nano S screen, you will need to write the word down in the corresponding position, e.g. word #1 in space #1, word #2 in space #2. Repeat this process until all 24 words have been written in the correct location.

**Step 7:** Confirm your Recovery Phrase. The Ledger Nano S will request confirmation of the 24 world recovery phrase by asking for the corresponding word for each number given, e.g. word #5, you would be required to confirm on the Ledger Nano S device the correct word. Navigate the selection of words using the left or right side buttons, and pressing both buttons to confirm. Repeat this process until complete.
