# Transaction Remains Unconfirmed

Sometimes a transaction can remain pending in the last operations list for a long time, up to several days. The time before a transaction gets its first confirmation depends on:

- the rate of network fees or gas included in the transaction
- the current load of pending transactions within the blockchain network

## **Wait Until The Transaction Is Dropped**

You can choose to continue waiting for a confirmation. The transaction may be confirmed, even if it can take days

You can also wait until the transaction is dropped from by the network, although this is not very likely to happen, depending on the specific network. When the transaction is dropped, it will disappear from your last operations
