# Fix Connection Issues

In some cases users may encounter connection issues when trying to connect their Ledger Nano S. If this occurs, try the following solutions one by one:

1.  Close all other applications _(Ledger apps, crypto wallets, Geth, Parity, Mist, Bitcoin Core, etc)_
2.  Turn off any VPN services
3.  Change the USB cable if possible  
    _Note: The replacement cable will need to be a two way data cable_
4.  Try different USB ports
5.  Restart your computer
6.  Try another computer
