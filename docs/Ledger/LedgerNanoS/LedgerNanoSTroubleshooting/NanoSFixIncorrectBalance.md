# Fix Incorrect Balance

_If your balance or transactions are incorrectly displayed in the Ledger Live application, there may be a problem with network synchronisation. You can try to fix this by clearing the cache._

## **Clear The Cache**

The transactions of the accounts in your portfolio are downloaded from the blockchain network. This data, the _cache_, is stored on your computer and optionally encrypted with your password. Clear the cache to delete the downloaded data and force a full resynchronisation with the network.

1.  Click on Settings.
2.  Click the **help** tab.
3.  Click the **clear** button to clear the cache.
4.  Click **confirm** after reading the instructions. The application will then reopen to your dashboard.

Once Ledger Live is synchronised, your balance should be correct.

## **Balance Still Incorrect?**

-   Ethereum smart contracts are currently **not supported**. ETH sent by a smart contract **will not be added** to your balance.
-   Check the network status indicator at the top right hand side of this page. If it is orange or red, the network service might be degraded. Click it to see more details on [Ledger's network status page](https://status.ledger.fr/).
