### What is a Ledger Hardware Wallet, and why should I use it with HYCON?

The [Ledger Nano S](https://ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) and [Ledger Blue](https://ledger.com/products/ledger-blue) are USB based hardware wallet devices that allow for the secure storage of private keys associated with accounts on the HYC blockchain. The private keys are generated from a 24 word mnemonic seed which should be stored securely to allow for recovery of the contents of the hardware wallet in the case of loss or damage. The key does not provide access to one HYC account, it in fact allows users to control multiple HYC addresses with a single secured key.

The private key stored on the Ledger Device never interacts with any networked environment, transactions are instead signed securely within the device, and then returned to the application as signed, valid transactions.

Here at HYCON we strongly advocate the use of hardware wallets as a secure way for users to interact with the blockchain, and we are endeavoring to make the process as smooth as possible.

In order to use a Ledger Device to interact with the HYCON network, the most convenient way is to use our desktop client, however Ledger functionality is also present in the GUI interface provided by a full HYCON node.

### Access your Accounts using Desktop Wallet

Now that everything is set up, you can start using the private keys on the device right away using _Desktop Wallet_.

1.  Open _Desktop Wallet_
2.  Make sure your Ledger device is connected and unlocked, and that you’ve opened the Hycon app
3.  Click on **MENU** icon at the right top corner. List will appear at the right side.
4.  Click on **LEDGER VIEW**
5.  An address selection modal will appear
6.  Select an address to interact with. Usually this will be the first one, but you can use any of them
7.  Click the **NEXT** button
8.  You should now see a screen that shows your account address and balance, and allow you to send HYC.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

### Send HYC from your Account

Assuming you’ve connected your device, unlocked it, selected an address in the desktop wallet and are on the summary page:

1.  Click on **TRANSFER** at the top right corner
2.  Enter an address in the _Address (To)_ field
3.  Enter an amount to send in the _Total Amount_ field
4.  Optionally, enter a fee in the _Fee_ field. Generally, you can skip this.
5.  Click **TRANSFER**. It will prompt you to confirm the transaction on your Ledger device. In order to do this, verify the information on your device’s screen and press the right-hand button (_Ledger Nano S_) or press the **CONFIRM** button (_Ledger Blue_)
6.  Your transaction should be processed in approximately one (1) minute*.

You should be able to see this transaction under the “_Transaction_” tab of your wallet, as well as on the Hycon [Blockexplorer](https://explorer.hycon.io/).
