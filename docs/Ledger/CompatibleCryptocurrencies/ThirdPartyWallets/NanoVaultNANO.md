## Your Ledger Status

On the left navigation you can find the current status of your Ledger device. When it is not connected, you will be unable to sign any new transactions or add new accounts. If the device status seems wrong, you can click on it to attempt to reconnect to the Ledger device. Your Ledger will only be marked as ready when it is unlocked and the Nano application is open.

## Receiving Transactions

2.  Press the ‘Receive’ button on the transaction you want to approve. This will trigger a confirmation on your Ledger device.

With that information, you are ready to store Nano with your Ledger Device and access it easily at any time using NanoVault! Besides just supporting Ledger devices, NanoVault also adds in lots of helpful features such as local currency values, a fully integrated address book, and more which make sending and receiving Nano simple and secure.

# Data Storage

NanoVault does not store any information about you on a server. The only information stored is in your local browser storage which allows you to use your wallet more easily on subsequent visits. With a Ledger device, the only information stored is your public account addresses, since that is the only information exposed by the Ledger device.
