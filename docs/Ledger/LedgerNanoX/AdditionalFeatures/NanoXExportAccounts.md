# Export your accounts

Coinstop and Ledger hold no responsibility for funds lost in error while exporting accounts. We recommend the use of hardware wallets because of their security standards.

>You are in control of your assets.

## Before you begin

>Your 24-word recovery phrase provides full access to your accounts. Entering your recovery phrase on a computer or smartphone may be insecure. Avoid doing so if possible.

-   Carefully select a hardware or software wallet. Protecting your accounts remains your own responsibility.
-   Contact [Ledger Support](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/ https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) when in doubt.

## Instructions

1.  Choose a BIP39/BIP44 compatible hardware  wallet  or software wallet.

### Third Party BIP39/BIP44 Compatible Software Wallets

>Entering your recovery phrase into a computer or smartphone is a security risk and should be avoided where possible.

Software wallets are highly insecure, have not been subjected to a security audit by Ledger and they should only be used for recovery as a last resort. If you proceed to use one of the software wallets below, you accept the responsibility for any possible outcome.

Accounts generated by a Ledger Nano X device can be recovered on any hardware or software wallet that supports the same standards as Ledger ([BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)/[BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)/[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)).

2.  Double-click the downloaded file to open it in a browser.
3.  Type your 24-word recovery phrase in the field **BIP39 Mnemonic**.

>Use lowercase only.

5.  Select a cryptocurrency.
6.  Leave the field **Internal/External** at **0**.

### Import your private keys

1.  Copy the list of generated private keys from the _**Derived Addresses**_ section. Use the controls below the list to show more rows or start at a certain index.
2.  Import your private keys in a third-party wallet that supports this, such as [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.com) or [Armory](https://www.bitcoinarmory.com).
3.  Set the field **Internal/External** to **1** to generate the private keys of your [change addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change).
