# Maximize battery life

Ledger Nano X has a 100 mAh Lithium-ion battery that will last several hours in use and a few months when idle on a full charge. Follow the tips in this article to maximize the battery life and lifespan of your Ledger Nano X.

## Charging the battery

Charge the battery to 100% to get the maximum battery life of several hours in use. Simply connect the USB-C port to a USB power source to charge it. The battery status icon in the top-right corner will display a charging symbol.

There is no need to fully discharge the battery until you charge it again. Battery life in use is best preserved by charging your device whenever you can. To check the battery charge level, hold both buttons to access the Control Center.

## Maximize battery lifespan

If you intend to store your Ledger Nano X for longer periods, the battery lifespan is best preserved by charging fully once every few months. Once fully charged, turn off the device and store it in a cool, moisture-free place.

It's best not store your Ledger Nano X for a prolonged period on a very low charge, since this may negatively affect battery capacity.

## End of life

The battery is designed to last 5 years. Ledger does not provide a battery replacement program. If battery capacity has degraded beyond being practically usable, the device can be used by connecting it to a power source using the USB cable.
