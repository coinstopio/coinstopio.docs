## Mobility

### Does Bluetooth affect the security of Ledger Nano X?  

The private keys never leave the secure chip, therefore Bluetooth communication (BLE) does not expose the Ledger Nano X to any additional security threat. The BLE connection is end-to-end encrypted to protect user privacy. In the unlikely case, the BLE transport were to be compromised, an attacker would never be able to extract private keys or make users sign a transaction they do not wish to sign.

### Does Ledger Nano X work with a smartphone app?  

The Ledger Live mobile app allows users to seamlessly manage their Ledger Nano X and the crypto it secures, anywhere they are. Ledger Live mobile requires smartphones with at least iOS 9 or Android 7.

### Can the Bluetooth connection be deactivated?  

Yes, Ledger Nano X can always be used with the included USB cable. Simply hold both buttons to access Control Center where Bluetooth can be directly disabled. Then connect the USB cable to your desktop computer.

### What is the battery life? Is the battery rechargeable?  

Ledger Nano X has a 100mAh battery. The device will last several hours in use and a few months when idle on a full charge. The battery can be easily recharged by connecting the USB-C port to the USB port of a laptop or desktop computer with the cable that's included. The battery cannot be replaced. It is designed to last 5 years.

### Can Ledger Nano X operate on its own?  

Ledger Nano X requires either a desktop computer (at least 64-bit Windows 8, macOS 10.8 or 64-bit Linux) or a smartphone (at least iOS 9 or Android 7) to install apps, to add accounts, to check account balances and to manage secure transactions.

## Capacity

### How many apps can be installed on the device?  

Ledger Nano X supports **up to** 100 simultaneously-installed apps. It has ten times more available storage space for apps compared to Ledger Nano S, though **the number of apps that can be installed depends on the size of the apps**.

### What apps does Ledger Nano X support?  

By default, all apps supported on the Ledger Nano S also run on the Ledger Nano X by using the USB cable and a desktop computer. Moreover, all apps supported in Ledger Live have Bluetooth support and an SDK will be provided to developers of third-party apps to add Bluetooth support too.

### Will the Ledger Nano X replace the Ledger Nano S?  

The Ledger Nano S will continue to remain available alongside the Ledger Nano X at an attractive price. Both models have their own advantages, complementing each other and catering to different types of users. One could use a Ledger Nano X to manage their crypto on the go, and leave their Ledger Nano S at home or in a vault as a backup. As such, Ledger Nano S will continue to be fully supported in the future.

### Is the Ledger Nano X more powerful than the Ledger Nano S?  

The Secure Element chip in the Ledger Nano X (ST33) is more powerful than the one in the Ledger Nano S (ST31). The Ledger Nano X is a bit more responsive compared to the Ledger Nano S, even if its performance is generally comparable.

### Can Ledger Nano X be used to manage crypto assets on a Ledger Nano S?  

Yes. By restoring a new Ledger Nano X from an existing 24-word recovery phrase it can manage the same crypto assets. Ledger Nano X could serve on the go, while the Ledger Nano S is used as at home or in a vault as a backup.

### Is the Ledger Nano X architecture different from that of Ledger Nano S?  

The Ledger Nano X architecture is an evolution of that of Ledger Nano S, thanks to its ST33 Secure Element chip. Besides having more memory this secure chip is directly connected to the display and buttons, leading to superior hardware architecture.

## Technical

### What is the size of the display?
