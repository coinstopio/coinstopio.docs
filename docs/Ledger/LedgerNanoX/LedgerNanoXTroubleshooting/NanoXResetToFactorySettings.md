# Reset to factory settings

Resetting the device to factory settings removes all private keys, applications and settings from your Ledger Nano X device. You can reset to [set it up as a new device](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018784134), to [restore another recovery phrase](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015132494) or to safely transfer the device to someone else.

## Before you start

-   Ensure that you are the sole holder of the 24-word recovery phrase that backs up the private keys on your device.

## Instructions

4.  Navigate to **General** and press both buttons to validate.
5.  Choose **Reset all** by pressing both buttons.
6.  Read the warnings and choose **Reset device** to validate.
7.  Enter your PIN code to confirm. Your device will then be reset.

Reset from PIN code

1.  Turn on your Ledger Nano X.
2.  Enter an incorrect PIN code three times in a row.
3.  The device will reset after the third incorrect attempt as a security measure.
