# Reset to factory settings

Resetting the device to factory settings removes all private keys, applications and settings from your Ledger Nano X device. You can reset to **[set it up as a new device]**, to **[restore another recovery phrase]** or to safely transfer the device to someone else.

## Before you start

Ensure that you are the sole holder of the 24-word recovery phrase that backs up the private keys on your device.

## Instructions

### Got your Recovery sheet?

>If you reset your device without holding your recovery sheet, the private keys providing access to your funds will be erased. **You will permanently lose access your funds.**

The device can either be reset from the settings menu or by entering three incorrect PIN codes when unlocking it. Please choose one of the two options below:

#### Reset From Device Settings

1.  Turn on and unlock your Ledger Nano X.
2.  Hold both buttons to access the **Control Center**.
3.  Navigate to **Settings** and press both buttons to validate.
4.  Navigate to **General** and press both buttons to validate.
5.  Choose **Reset all** by pressing both buttons.
6.  Read the warnings and choose **Reset device** to validate.
7.  Enter your PIN code to confirm. Your device will then be reset.

#### Reset From PIN Code

1.  Turn on your Ledger Nano X.
2.  Enter an incorrect PIN code three times in a row.
3.  The device will reset after the third incorrect attempt as a security measure.
