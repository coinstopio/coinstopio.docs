# Receive Cryptocurrency

You can receive crypto assets on accounts managed by your Ledger Nano X device by generating a receive address in the Ledger Live app.

>Always send a small amount first. Then verify that the transaction was properly received by the recipient address before proceeding to send larger amounts.

## Before You Begin

-   Ledger Live should be ready to use.
-   Check that the right app is installed on your Ledger Nano X.  
    >Install the Bitcoin app to receive Bitcoin.

## Instructions

1.  Tap the **Transact** tab at the bottom of the app.
2.  Tap **Receive**.
3.  Choose the Account to credit.
4.  Choose the Ledger Nano X that manages the account to credit.
    -   Make sure the device is turned on and unlocked.
    -   Open the cryptocurrency app as instructed.
5.  Read the on-screen instructions and tap on **Verify** to display a receive address on your Ledger Nano X.
6.  View the address and verify that it is the same as the address shown in Ledger Live.
    -   **If the addresses match:** Press the right button to select **Approve**, then press both buttons to confirm the address shown in Ledger Live.
7.  Click **Copy** or **Share** and share the address with the sender of the transaction. Carefully check that the address does not change after you copy and paste it or tap the **Re-verify** button to display on your device again.

>If the addresses do not match, select **Reject** on your device and **do not send any crypto assets** to it.

### Don't Have Your Device?

-   On the account selection screen, click on **Don't have your device?** to generate a receive address.

>The generated receive address does not benefit from the optimal level of security because the receive address on Ledger Live is not verified on your Ledger Nano X.

## Why Receive Addresses Change

You've generated an address for the selected account, that you can share with the sender.

-   Blockchains based on Bitcoin are public networks. For optimal privacy, the addresses of those cryptocurrencies should generally not be re-used after a transaction.
-   Ledger Live generates new addresses for cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin.
-   For cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin, the previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy.
