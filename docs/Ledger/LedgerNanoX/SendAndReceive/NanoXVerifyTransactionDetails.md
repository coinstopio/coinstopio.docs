# Verify Transaction Details On Your Ledger Nano X

Before sending and receiving cryptocurrencies, familiarize yourself with the secure operations enabled by your Ledger hardware wallet. Cryptocurrencies you manage using your Ledger device can be targeted by malicious actors. Optimize your asset security by transacting with caution.

## Don't trust, verify

>Assume that your computer or smartphone is compromised. You should only trust information displayed on your Ledger device's screen.

## Sending

-   Always send a small amount first. Then verify that the transaction was properly received by the recipient before proceeding to send larger amounts.
-   Check recipient addresses after you copy and paste. Malware on your computer or smartphone might replace addresses in your clipboard.
-   Verify that the recipient address, amount and fees are correct and that they are the same on both your computer or smartphone and the deviceâ€™s screen when sending a transaction.

## Receiving

-   Verify that each address used to receive transactions belongs to you by displaying it on your hardware wallet. Addresses shown in Ledger Live could be manipulated if your computer or smartphone is compromised.
-   Wait for a significant amount of confirmations before accepting a transaction. For Bitcoin, six confirmations are generally recommended.

>Even if Ledger Live can provide receiving addresses without a Ledger device, these addresses provide suboptimal security. Choosing to use unverified addresses comes at your own risk.
