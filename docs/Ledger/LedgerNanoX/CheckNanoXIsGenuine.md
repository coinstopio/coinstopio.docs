# Check If Ledger Nano S Is Genuine

Ledger products are built around a combination of hardware and software security, meant to protect your private keys from a wide range of attacks. Use this guide to make sure your Ledger Nano X is genuine, and not fraudulent or counterfeit.

A few simple checks will assure you that your device is a genuine Ledger product:

-   Origin of the Ledger product
-   Box contents
-   Condition of the Recovery sheet
-   Initial state of the Ledger device.

-   USB Type-C cable
-   5 paper cards in an envelope, including:
    -   _Getting started_ leaflet;
    -   _Use, Care and Regulatory Statement_;
    -   3 blank _Recovery sheets_.

## Recovery Sheets Should Not Come Pre-Filled

Once you set up your Ledger Nano X, it will generate a new 24-word recovery phrase for you to write down on a Recovery sheet. If someone else were to know your recovery phrase, you can lose all your crypto assets. Follow the guidelines below to ensure the security of your assets:

-   **Make sure your Recovery sheets came in blank.**
-   If your Recovery sheets  already have words on them: The device is not safe to use. Please contact [Ledger Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.
-   Ledger **never** provides a 24-word recovery phrase in any way, shape or form. The recovery phrase should be empty, like the image below.

>Only accept a recovery phrase obtained from the screen of your Ledger Nano X.

## Check For Factory Settings

-   When turning on your Ledger Nano X for the first time, it should display the **Ledger Logo,** then release the button and then **Welcome to Ledger Nano X - Press right to continue**. This can be seen in the image below.

>Ledger never provides a PIN code in any way, shape or form.  Always choose the PIN code yourself.

-   If a PIN code is included in the packaging or instructions to get one elsewhere, or if the device requires a PIN code the first time you use it: the device is not safe to use. Please contact** [**Ledger Support**](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.

## Check authenticity with Ledger applications

-   Set up your Ledger device with [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live) to verify its authenticity.
-   Genuine Ledger devices hold a secret key that is set during manufacture.
-   Only a genuine Ledger device can use its key to provide the cryptographic proof required to connect with Ledgerâ€™s secure server.

#### Summary

-   Check your Recovery sheets came in blank.
-   Set up your Ledger Nano X by yourself. The **Welcome** screen should be displayed when first starting your device.
-   Choose your own PIN code.
-   Contact [Ledger Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in case of doubt.

### Anti Tamper Seals

Ledger deliberately chooses not to use anti tamper seals on its packaging. These seals are easy to counterfeit and can therefore be misleading. Rather, genuine Ledger devices contain a secure chip that prevents physical tampering: this provides stronger security than any sticker possibly could.
