# Check if device is genuine

Ledger products are built around a combination of hardware and software security, meant to protect your private keys from a wide range of attacks. Use this guide to make sure your Ledger Nano X is genuine, and not fraudulent or counterfeit.

A few simple checks will assure you that your device is a genuine Ledger product:

-   Origin of the Ledger product
-   Box contents
-   Condition of the Recovery sheet
-   Initial state of the Ledger device.

## Check the Recovery sheets came blank

Once you set up your Ledger Nano X, it will generate a new 24-word recovery phrase for you to write down on a Recovery sheet. If someone else were to know your recovery phrase, you can lose all your crypto assets. Follow the guidelines below to ensure the security of your assets:

-   **Make sure your Recovery sheets came in blank.**
-   If your Recovery sheets  already have words on them: The device is not safe to use.  
    **Please contact [Ledger Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)** **for assistance**.
-   Ledger **never** provides a 24-word recovery phrase in any way, shape or form. **Only** accept a recovery phrase **obtained from the screen of your Ledger Nano X**.

    **Always choose the PIN code yourself.**
-   If a PIN code is included in the packaging or instructions to get one elsewhere, or if the device requires a PIN code the first time you use it: the device is not safe to use.

### Anti tamper seals

Ledger deliberately chooses not to use anti tamper seals on its packaging. These seals are easy to counterfeit and can therefore be misleading. Rather, genuine Ledger devices contain a secure chip that prevents physical tampering: this provides stronger security than any sticker possibly could.

### Hardware integrity check

Advanced users can check the hardware integrity on the inside of their Ledger device. **This article** provides a non-exhaustive chronology of the different revisions of the Ledger Nano X build. Please be aware that normal usage does not involve opening your Ledger device. Proceed to do so at your own risk. Ledger can not be held liable for any possible damage resulting from opening the device.
