Transaction Remains Unconfirmed

Sometimes a transaction can remain pending in the last operations list for a long time, up to several days. The time before a transaction gets its first confirmation depends on:

    the rate of network fees or gas included in the transaction
    the current load of pending transactions within the blockchain network

Learn more about network fees or the status of a transaction.

WAIT UNTIL THE TRANSACTION IS DROPPED

    You can choose to continue waiting for a confirmation. The transaction may be confirmed, even if it can take days
    You can also wait until the transaction is dropped from by the network, although this is not very likely to happen, depending on the specific network
    When the transaction is dropped, it will disappear from your last operations

INCREASE THE NETWORK FEES

Instead of waiting, you can increase the network fees to accelerate your transaction. Currently this is only possible in the Ledger Wallet Bitcoin Chrome application. It will be implemented in Ledger Live later.

    Download and install the Ledger Wallet Bitcoin Chrome application
    Open the Ledger Bitcoin Wallet Chrome application
    Connect and unlock your Ledger device
    Click on the pending operation to open its details.
    Click the lightning bolt icon in the bottom left corner. The tool will propose you an increased network fee rate such that the transaction will urgently be confirmed
    Carefully review the fee rate, it can be very high
    Either accept or cancel, and confirm on your Ledger device
