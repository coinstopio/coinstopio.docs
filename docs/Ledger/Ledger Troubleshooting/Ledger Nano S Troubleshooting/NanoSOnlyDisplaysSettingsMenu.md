# Nano S Is Only Displaying Settings Menu

If you can only access the **settings** menu of your Ledger Nano S, you probably have recently reset or updated your Ledger Nano S.

Once your update or reset is complete, your Nano S will be entirely wiped, which is why you can only access the **settings** menu of your device. You will not have any other applications installed on your Nano S following the update or reset, so now you must reinstall all of your applications from the Ledger Manager using this tutorial.
