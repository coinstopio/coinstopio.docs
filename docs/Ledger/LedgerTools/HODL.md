Directly enter cryptocurrency receive addresses on your computer using the HODL app on your Ledger Nano S device. HODL transforms your Ledger Nano S into a keyboard to directly type your receive addresses. Get started using the instructions in this article.

## Instructions

### Step 1. Install HODL

>Make sure your Ledger Nano S is updated to the latest firmware.

1.  Either open the **Manager** in Ledger Live, **OR** open the legacy Ledger Manager.
2.  Connect and unlock your device using your PIN code.
3.  Press the right button on your device to **allow** **Ledger manager**.
4.  Find **HODL** in the App catalog in Ledger Live and click **Install**.  An installation window will appear.
5.  Navigate to HODL on the dashboard of your device, once it has been installed.
6.  (Mac only) Press both buttons to open HODL. Close the Keyboard Setup Assistant that opens on your Mac. This only needs to be done once.

If the app could not be installed, free up some storage space by uninstalling apps. This does not affect your crypto assets, secured in the blockchain.

### Step 2. Launch HODL

-   Connect and unlock your device using your PIN code.
-   Press the right or left button to select the HODL app from the dashboard.
-   Press both buttons to enter.

### Step 3. Set keyboard layout

This step needs to be done only once when switching keyboard layouts.

1.  Press the right button to select **Settings**. Press both buttons to enter.
2.  Select **Keyboard layout**. Press both buttons to enter.
3.  Select the layout of your computer keyboard. Qwerty, Qwerty Intâ€™l and Azerty are supported. Press both buttons to confirm.

### Step 4. Select crypto asset and address format

1.  Select **New address** from the main menu. Press both buttons to enter.
2.  Select a cryptocurrency. Press both buttons to enter.
3.  Select an address format. This option depends on the selected cryptocurrency. Bitcoin supports Legacy, Segwit and Bech32 address formats.

### Step 5. Select account and address index

1.  Check the account and index shown on the device display as **/account/index****.** Example: **/0/0** indicates that the **first** **address** of the **first account** is selected, since accounts and indexes start counting from zero.  
    
2.  To change the selected account: select **Next account** or **Previous account** and press both buttons to confirm. Note that the account has changed.  
    
3.  To change the selected address index: select **Next index** or **Previous index** and press both buttons to enter. Note that the address index has changed.

### Step 6. Generate and verify address

2.  Select **Generate** on your Ledger Nano S. Press both buttons to enter the address.  
    
3.  **Verify that the address on the Ledger Nano S screen matches with the address on your computer screen. Press the right button located above the validation icon to confirm.**
