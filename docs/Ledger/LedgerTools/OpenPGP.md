# OpenPGP

Install the OpenPGP app on your Ledger Nano S device to sign encrypted messages through [GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)](https://gnupg.org/). This app is for developers that are proficient in using OpenPGP.

>It only becomes available in the Manager if developer mode is activated in **Settings** > **General**.

The private keys used are not generated by the seed configured on the Ledger Nano S. Carefully back them up by yourself. 

>An [experimental add-on](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-openpgp-card/blob/master/doc/developper/gpgcard3.0-addon.rst) can generate the PGP keys from the seed, although it is not fully tested.
