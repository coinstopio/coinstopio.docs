# KeepKey Setup

Before you get started, it's important to check to ensure that your have purchased a genuine Ledger product. To do this, simply ask yourself these questions:

-   Where did my product come from?
    -   To ensure there is no interference with the product, it's best to order from an Authorised Reseller - like us! To check Coinstop's reseller status, simply visit the reseller page on the KeepKey website.
-   What's inside the box?
    -   The contents of the KeepKey box should be the following:
        -   KeepKey device
        -   USB cable
        -   Recovery Sheet
-   How does it look?
    -   Your recovery sheet should be blank, and the contents of the box should be neatly arranged.
    -   Ensure the device has not been preconfigured.

  

**INITIALISING THE KEEPKEY**

**Step 1:** You will need a KeepKey device, the USB cable included in the packaging, an up-to-date Chrome web browser, your Recovery Card and a pen to write your recovery phrase.

**Step 1:** Download and install the KeepKey Client App from the Chrome web store.

**Step 2:** Use the USB cable to connect KeepKey to your computer.

**Step 3:** Open Chrome and locate the KeepKey Client App. (note: You can get to Chrome Apps by navigating Chrome to “chrome://apps/”)

**Step 4:** Follow the directions on your device to update the firmware and bootloader.

**Step 5:** Select **Initialise KeepKey**

**Step 6:** Select label for your KeepKey (this can be changed later). A label helps you distinguish your KeepKey in case you own multiple devices.

**Step 7:** Select a PIN between 1-9 digits. (note: We recommend a PIN length of at least 6 digits)

_You will see a randomised, scrambled keypad on your KeepKey display. Find a number you want to choose, then click on the corresponding location in the KeepKey Client Chrome App._

_KeepKey scrambled the PIN like this so that the connected computer never learns your PIN. It may seem confusing at first, but once you get comfortable with the PIN entry mechanism, you can use KeepKey on an untrusted computer without worrying that your PIN was discovered._

**Step 8:** Confirm your PIN. (note: Keypad number placement is scrambled again, so you will need to examine KeepKey’s display once more to find the correct location for the PIN choice in the KeepKey Client Chrome App)

**Step 9:** Write down the 12-word recovery sentence displayed on your device. This 12-word recovery sentence serves as the backup for your device, and you can use it to restore your funds if you lose access to your KeepKey. As you write down the sentence, carefully confirm that each word is written down correctly. You are only shown this sentence once, and it is very important that you have it written down correctly and in the correct order.

Keep the recovery sentence in a safe and secure place. You will need it to recover your account funds and private keys if your KeepKey is lost or stolen. Anyone who discovers your recovery sentence can access all of your funds.
