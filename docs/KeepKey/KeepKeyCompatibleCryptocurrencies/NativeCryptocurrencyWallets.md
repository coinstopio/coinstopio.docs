# List of Cryptocurrencies

_Please Note:_

_KeepKeyâ€™s unique support for ERC-20 tokens is native and therefore does not rely on a third-party wallet to create raw transactions._

_Every Ethereum account on your KeepKey device will only have one unique address - you cannot generate another address for that account. ERC-20 tokens share the same receiving address as your Ethereum address. In order to receive ERC-20 tokens to your KeepKey, you will need to first create an Ethereum account on your KeepKey device. All of our supported ERC-20 tokens will be listed as sub-accounts under that ETH account._

_Once you have received ERC-20 tokens, please remember that you will need a balance in your Ethereum account on your KeepKey for transaction gas in order to send funds from any of your ERC-20 token sub-accounts. As soon as your main Ethereum account has a balance, you should not have a problem sending any of your ERC-20 tokens to a destination address._
