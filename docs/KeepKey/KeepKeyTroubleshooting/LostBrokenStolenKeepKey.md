# Lost, Stolen, Or Broken KeepKey

In the event that your device is lost, stolen or broken you can use your 12-word recovery sentence to restore all of your assets. As long as you have a strong PIN code enabled on your KeepKey, your device is useless in the hands of a thief.

  

_If you do not have multiple accounts, you can recover your digital assets on any wallet that is BIP39 compatible._

_If you have more than one account, you can recover in any wallet that is BIP44 compatible._  
  

The wallets listed below are BIP44 compatible:

-   [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/)
-   [JAXX](https://jaxx.io/)
-   [CoPay](https://copay.io/)
-   [MyCelium](https://mycelium.com/)
