# Setting Up Your Billfodl

Your BillFodl pack should contain the following:
-   1x BillFodl hardware unit
-   Alphanumeric tiles (A-Z / 1-9)

## **GETTING STARTED**

Carefully open the BillFodl packaging on a clean workspace, laying out the BillFodl hardware with the laser engraved logo facing upward. You should also see the numbered slots 1-12. (add photo)

Pick up one (1) of the lettered tiles, and use this to undo the screw in the top right hand corner of the BillFodl, this will unlock the top latch allowing you to add the tiles into the slots. Do the same for the bottom screw and latch. (add photo)

Now you can begin inserting the lettered tiles (and/or numbered tiles if entering raw key text string) into the BillFodl. If you are inserting only the lettered tiles because you are entering you 24 word recovery phrase, you will only need to enter the first four (4) letters of each word. (why first four letters)

Once the first 12 words have been entered, you can check the words to ensure they are correct. If correct, close the latches (top and bottom) and use a lettered tile to tighten the screws once again.

> _NOTE: Ensure that each row you are using is full of tiles, using blank spaces as necessary to fill up the row. There should be no way to move the tiles when the latch is closed._

_During torture tests, it has been discovered that Billfodls which are not completely full may warp in extreme (greater than 600 deg C) heat._
